Student Name: Keerthana S

📖 Overview

This project implements a custom Python ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) connector. The pipeline fetches data from a public API, transforms it into a MongoDB-compatible format, and loads it into a MongoDB collection.

All API credentials are stored securely using environment variables. The pipeline includes error handling, validation, and logging for reliable data ingestion.

🔗 API Details

Selected API Provider: Example API (replace with your actual API)
Base URL: https://api.example.com/
Endpoints Used:

details

bandwidth

clients

Authentication:
API key is stored securely in .env and loaded using dotenv.

Example .env file:

API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017


Sample API Response (details):

{
  "country_name": "United States of America",
  "organization": "Example Org",
  "city": "New York",
  "state": "NY",
  "isp": "Example ISP"
}

⚙️ ETL Pipeline
1. Extract

Connects to the API using headers and API key.

Fetches JSON data from multiple endpoints (details, bandwidth, clients).

2. Transform

Extracts relevant fields for MongoDB compatibility.

Adds fetched_at timestamp using UTC.

Handles empty or invalid responses.

3. Load

Saves transformed data into JSON files in output/ folder.

Inserts data into MongoDB collections named:

details_raw, bandwidth_raw, clients_raw


Includes timestamps for auditing.

Sample JSON File (details_1761295482.json):

{
  "fetched_at": "2025-10-24T14:00:00Z",
  "country_name": "United States of America",
  "organization": "Example Org",
  "city": "New York",
  "state": "NY",
  "isp": "Example ISP"
}

🧪 Testing & Validation

Handles invalid responses and empty payloads.

Respects API rate limits; retries failed requests.

Validates JSON output and MongoDB insertion.

Logs success and errors during ETL execution.

📦 Dependencies
